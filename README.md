# Galalea

#The project “Galalea” is a fantastical 3D world that the user can explore in browser. The user’s purpose is to collect the lost artifacts of Galalea scattered around the world. With its large trees and colorful structures, this world will capture the nostalgia of exploring 3D worlds like those of the MMO games Free Realms and VMK. The world of Galalea was created using the Three.js library, which makes it easier to utilize WebGL. The models were created in Blender, textures in Clip Studio Paint, and the Three.js editor was used to apply textures to the models.
